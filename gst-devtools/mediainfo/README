= Media detail browser =
The package contains a UI for browsing media files and showing details of the
files.

= Usage =
The left side of the window has a file-browser. This has the keyborad focus.
Going through the files will show the media details immediately on the right
side. When staying on a file for a moment, the file will be played.

The information shown on the left side is enhanced for human readability. E.g.
codec and fomat names are turned into wikipedia links.

The UI has a compact mode for small screens (height < 600) where all streams
are in one notebook.
